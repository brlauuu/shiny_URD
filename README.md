# Shiny URD

Small Shiny Web app for exploring data generated by [URD](https://github.com/farrellja/URD). License stands only for this project.

# Requirements

Required libraries:

* [URD](https://github.com/farrellja/URD)
* [shiny](https://shiny.rstudio.com/)
* [shinycssloaders](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/shinycssloaders/index.html)
* [ggplot2](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/)
* [gridExtra](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/gridExtra/index.html)

# Usage

Clone repository. Copy (or link) URD files to `data` directory. Once the application is started, select a file that you want to load. Depending on the file size, it might take a while until URD object is loaded. After that select 1 or more features you wish to visualize on the tree. If you select 1 feature, a tree with plotted values is shown. 2 features result in `dualTree` which shows simultaneously the values in green and red on the tree. 3 or more features selected result in a grid of plots.

With sliders, you can control the size of the plot as well as the size of downloaded plot.
